# Introduction

In Cairo, a trait is a series of methods that can be implemented by a data type. When a trait is implemented for a type, the methods defined in that trait can be called on instances of that type. A trait is not limited to only a singular type but when combined with generic type, the functionality defined in the trait can be invoked on a particular type and can share these methods with other data types.
